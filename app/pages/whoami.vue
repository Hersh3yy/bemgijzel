Then in 2015 these skills turned out to be very helpful when I discovered the freedom and pleasure of acting in front of the camera giving that little extra bit of my personality. Since then I had the chance to play big roles in small productions and small things in big ones. In 2018 I reached the semi finals of FILMSTER GEZOCHT, a casting show of SBS6.",
